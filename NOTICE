The Free and Open Source Software (“FOSS”) products identified below are either
packaged separately or integrated together with Alcatel-Lucent product.
Each of these FOSS products was released under a license as indicated below.
Unless otherwise dictated by a FOSS license (such as GPL, LGPL, and Affero GPL)
that requires Alcatel-Lucent to grant the same rights to the parties to whom we
distribute the FOSS, your rights to use, copy, and further distribute (if applicable)
the FOSS are governed by the Alcatel-Lucent license packaged with the Alcatel-Lucent
product with which the FOSS is provided.

For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting any rights you may obtain independent
of Alcatel-Lucent, except as set forth in the Alcatel-Lucent license packaged
with the Alcatel-Lucent product with which the FOSS is provided:
   (i)	no right is granted by Alcatel-Lucent to reproduce, modify and/or redistribute
		FOSS that was released under and governed by a license (such as MIT, original BSD,
		new BSD, Apache, CDDL, CPL, EPL  and Mozilla) that DOES NOT require Alcatel-Lucent
		to grant the same rights to the parties to whom we distribute the FOSS, and 
        
  (ii)	no other licenses, express or implied, are granted, with respect to Alcatel-Lucent
		intellectual property, including, without limitation, Alcatel-Lucent copyrights,
		patents, trade secrets, trademarks or logos.

 (iii)	In the event you are permitted to and do in fact modify any FOSS,
 		then notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, Alcatel-Lucent will
 		have no further liability or obligation to provide support, maintenance, warranty
 		or indemnity with respect to the Alcatel-Lucent products with which
 		the modified version of the FOSS interacts.
