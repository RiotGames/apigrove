1. Installation

The front-end project directory is a functional Zend application. To run this
Zend application, install Zend Framework and serve "front-end/public" with an
http server that supports PHP.

If you have neither Zend Framework installed nor a http server installed, check
out Zend Server which conveniently packages both.

Alternatively, on Red Hat or CentOS you can install with yum:

yum -y install httpd php53 php53-mbstring libmcrypt php53-mcrypt php53-pdo


1a. Installing Zend Framework

The Zend Framework is a directory named "Zend" and is filled with *.php files.
This directory must be copied to a static location on your machine. The
absolute path to this static location must be added to php's "include_path"
property. Set this property in your php.ini file, typically located in /etc.

You must also set the appropriate permissions for the Zend Framework files. Below {ZF_HOME} refers to the
location where you installed Zend Framework's 'Zend' directory:
find {ZF_HOME} -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 644
find {ZF_HOME} -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 755

1b. Serving "front-end/public" with an http server

You must have an http server that supports interpreting php files and serving
static files. nginx and apache's httpd are both known to do this. This section
covers apache's httpd.  

To interpret php files, httpd must have at least one module of these modules 
enabled: mod_cgi, mod_fastcgi, or mod_php (libphp5). Each of these modules is
configured differently.

A VirtualHost setting is an easy way to tell httpd what files to serve. Add a
new virtual host to your apache config:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName somehostname
    DocumentRoot /<some>/<path>/<to>/front-end/public

    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"

    <Directory /<some>/<path>/<to>/front-end/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

You will also need to make sure that php short tags are enabled. In your php.ini file find the
"short_open_tag" setting and make sure that it is set to "On".

Next, you will need to set the appropriate permissions on the files. Make sure to edit these commands
to point to where you have installed the front-end web app before using.

find /<some>/<path>/front-end -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 644
find /<some>/<path>/front-end -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 755
find /<some>/<path>/front-end/application/data -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 666
find /<some>/<path>/front-end/application/configs/manager.ini -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod -R 666
