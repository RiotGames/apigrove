## The Api Grove Front End packaged-installer
#########

This installer package has been strictly designed for RHEL 5.8 x86_64. Do not
run this installer package on other operating systems.

Unpack the Api Grove Front End installer with:

    mkdir apigrove-installer-front-end-module
    tar xzf apigrove-installer-front-end-module_5.0.12-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz -C apigrove-installer-front-end-module

After unpacking the installer, cd into the scripts directory:

    cd apigrove-installer-front-end-module/scripts

Back up your yum repository settings in "/etc/yum.repos.d". These repos will
also be backed up to "repobkp" in the scripts directory.

	tar cf /etc/yum.repos.d_backup.tar -C /etc yum.repos.d

Run the installer with /bin/sh:

    /bin/sh install.sh

The install script will create and install a local and very limited yum
repository. Restore your yum repos by copying files back into yum.repos.d

	cp repobkp/* /etc/yum.repos.d

    
Zend will now be installed in /usr/local/share/php. The front-end webapp will
be installed in /var/www/front-end. The application will be hosted on port
24100.
